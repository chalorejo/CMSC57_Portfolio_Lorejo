                    <p class="about-description">Welcome to my CMSC 57 ePortfolio! This is a collection of everything I’ve learned, 
                        reflected on, and applied throughout the course Discrete Structures in Computer Science. Each section connects 
                        abstract mathematical concepts to real problems in computing, like building smarter algorithms, making secure systems, or 
                        understanding how data travels through networks. By putting theory into context, I’ve come to appreciate just how much 
                        math powers the world of technology and how much it shapes the way we think as computer scientists.

                        <p class="details-description">We started with the basics of counting permutations, combinations, 
                            the Pigeonhole Principle, and generating sequences. My favorite part was generating permutations 
                            and combinations. There’s something satisfying about knowing you can follow a set of 
                            rules and predict every possible order or combination.

                        <p class="details-description">Counting shows up all over CS. From figuring out how secure a 
                            password is to brute-force algorithms and solving optimization problems, it’s a key skill.

                        <p class="details-description">When working on a password generator, I realized how counting helps measure security. 
                            For example, an 8-character password made of lowercase letters has 26826^8 combinations, which is over 200 billion! 
                            That’s a good reminder that even small changes in length or character set can make systems much harder to crack.<br><br>
                            This topic trained me to think in terms of possibilities and limits. It helped me understand algorithm complexity
                             and made me more thoughtful when designing solutions that involve large datasets or decision trees.

                        <p class="details-description">We explored transformations like rotating or flipping a square 
                            and how these form groups when you combine them. We learned about identity elements, inverses, and 
                            associativity. I liked how visual this topic was. Seeing symmetry in action made these abstract 
                            ideas easier to understand.

                            computer graphics for rotating objects, and even in coding theory for fixing transmission errors.

                        <p class="details-description">A Rubik’s Cube is a real-world group, each twist is like applying a group operation. 
                            Solving the cube means understanding how these moves interact. Another cool example: in robotics, transformations
                            form groups that control how robots move and return to a starting position.<br><br>
                            This topic helped me see structure in systems. I now recognize how operations relate to each other 
                            and how that relationship creates predictability in code and design.

                            and fields. These go beyond just numbers and allow us to define operations over sets in a structured way. 
                            What stood out to me was how something like modulo arithmetic can build an entire system.

                        <p class="details-description">I looked into CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for data transmission. It uses 
                            arithmetic over GF(2) basically modulo 2, to check for errors. Simple concept, powerful results.<br><br>
                            It amazed me how much reliability we get from just a few algebraic rules. Understanding fields and rings showed me that clean, 
                            consistent logic is often hiding behind the scenes in systems we take for granted.

                        <p class="details-description">Discrete probability plays a big role in machine learning, AI 
                            decision-making, predictive analytics, and algorithms that need to adapt to uncertain input.

                        <p class="details-description">I looked into how likely it is for a server to fail in a small network 
                            with several nodes. I used basic probability distributions to estimate how reliable the system would 
                            be and how often it might go down.<br><br>
                            This topic taught me how to bring structure to randomness. Probability helps us make smart guesses when 
                            we don’t have all the facts, something that happens a lot in the real world.

                        <p class="details-description">This was one of the most fun topics. We studied graphs and their types, 
                            connectivity, paths (Euler and Hamiltonian), shortest-path algorithms, graph coloring, and more.

                        <p class="details-description">I used Dijkstra’s algorithm in C++ to calculate the shortest route between 
                            cities. I also applied graph coloring to a class scheduling problem, ensuring that no overlapping classes 
                            were assigned the same time slot. <br><br>
                            Working with graphs helped me think visually and logically at the same time. Whether it’s debugging a 
                            program or mapping relationships in a system, graph theory gave me the tools to understand complexity more clearly.

                    <p class="about-description">CMSC 57 has been more than just a math course. 
                        It’s given me a way to think logically, structurally, and critically. Whether 
                        I’m analyzing the number of outcomes in a problem, designing secure systems, modeling 
                        uncertainty, or mapping data, the skills I’ve gained here will stay with me. These 
                        concepts may seem abstract at first, but they are deeply connected to the tools and 
                        systems we use every day in computer science. This ePortfolio is not just a summary 
                        of what I’ve learned, it’s the starting point for the kind of thoughtful, 
                        well-designed solutions I want to build as a future software engineer.
